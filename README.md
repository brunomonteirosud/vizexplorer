# Practical Assessment for VizExplorer
## by Bruno Monteiro

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

The client requires a new front­end application for viewing a dataset of their ‘players’. The application needs to load the dataset from file and display the data in a neatly styled and formatted table. The client would also like to add new players to table.

**EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR**
* On initialisation, the collection of ‘player’ data should be loaded into the table.
* Clicking the ‘add player’ button should open a dialogue box/modal with a form for adding a new ‘player’ record:
* All of the fields in this form are required*.
* The inputs for these form fields should be validated, when it is reasonable to do
so.
* Clicking ‘Add’ should update the table of players dynamically ­ you should be
able to see the new player record added to the table, immediately.
* The user should be able to select a ‘player’ record in the table with a mouse click event.
* The user should be able to sort the rows of the table by clicking on the title/header of each column. The rows should be sorted alphabetically, and toggle between descending and ascending order with each mouse click event.

**REQUIREMENTS**
* Styling of the web page should be done using a CSS preprocessor. We would prefer that you use LESS, but SASS is also acceptable. You should leverage best practices, and the features of your chosen preprocessor to maximize reuse, extensibility, and clarity of your code.
* Twitter Bootstrap (>= 3.x) should be used as your CSS3 framework.
* The application itself should be written in AngularJS, minimum version 1.5.x.
* Preferably​your application will follow one of the popular codes styles for AngularJS. John Papas and Todd Motto both have well documented code styles that you may want to follow. P​lease specify which code style you chose to follow when you submit your assignment.
* All data that is demonstrated in the application should be defined in a JSON file, and loaded using the AngularJS $​http​module.
* Make use of the SVG images and Adobe Illustrator files provided in the assignment zip.
* The finished product should look like the provided mock up. This includes, but is not limited to the layout, typography and colour palette.
* The assignment should be version controlled using a​public GitHub​repository. This will be used to keep track of your how long you have spent on the assignment, and to monitor how frequently you commit your code.
* You should work on this assignment for no longer than 4​hours
